# Fooling the Machine
Fooling the Machine is the final project for Nature of Code-Intelligence-Learning, taught by Daniel Shiffman at ITP, NYU

Fooling the Machine is an interactive Installation that generates 10 images of digits 0, 1...9 with users' drawings.

### Process
It started with a simple machine learning model that recognizes and categorilize handwriting digits using MNIST dataset. With 15 iterations of training on 60,000 handwriting digits, the system achieves 99.56% accurancy on training dataset and 99.17% accurancy on testing dataset.
